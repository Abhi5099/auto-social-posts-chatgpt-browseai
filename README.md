# Auto Social Posts with ChatGPT & Browse AI

## About
This project automates the process of monitoring website content and turning it into social media posts using a no-code Make.com scenario. By combining Browse AI and ChatGPT, it extracts key information from web pages and generates platform-ready posts, which are automatically published to LinkedIn and Facebook. Ideal for keeping social media channels active and engaging without manual effort.

## Tools & Platforms Used
- [Make.com](https://www.make.com/) – Visual automation builder
- [Browse AI](https://www.browse.ai/) – No-code web scraping and monitoring
- [OpenAI (ChatGPT)](https://platform.openai.com/) – AI-generated content creation
- LinkedIn & Facebook – Social media platforms for post distribution

## How it Works
1. **Browse AI** monitors a specific website and detects new or updated content.
2. Once a change is detected, **Make.com** triggers the automation.
3. A **Router** sends data to two separate OpenAI modules to create tailored summaries for:
   - **LinkedIn**
   - **Facebook**
4. The generated content is then automatically published to the respective platforms.

## Purpose and Problem It Solves
This automation solves the problem of manually tracking and sharing updates from a website across multiple social media channels. It enables businesses and content creators to:
- Stay consistent with their posting
- Share fresh content in real-time
- Save time on manual summarization and formatting
